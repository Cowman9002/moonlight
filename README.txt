Game / final project for a class made in about one week.
Very buggy, not very fun.
3D renderer in console designed to showcase networking using TCP in a real-time environment.

I've tested it on Windows 11 and Windows 10.
Linux support is not likely due to some Windows specific functions I needed to get keys and the console working

Start the moonlight_server and optionally enter an ip or leave it empty to open on all ports

Start the moonlight_client in a dedicated console window and enter the ip of the server
Follow the controls on the main screen and press enter when prompted
If it is hard to see try adjusting the colors and scale of the terminal. I used campbell theme for texture design if you have access to that.
